# 4bit_ring_counter
INTRODUCTION
This project simulates the design of a 4-bit ring counter using verilog HDL. A ring counter works in a similar way as a shift register. The only difference is that the output of the last flip-flop is connected to the input of the first flip-flop. In this way, the counter forms a ring and hence is called ring counter. In this design, four D-Flip-flops are used with clock and ori(override input) signals.
